## About GRPM BERTopic Analysis
This analysis employs the BERTopic pipeline to:
1. Utilize a curated dataset enriched with genetic features related to nutrigenomics.
2. Preprocess the dataset based on MeSH terms specifically chosen for the nutrigenomics domain.
3. Implement the BERTopic methodology to perform topic modeling on the dataset, enabling a structured exploration of genetic influences, interactions, and implications in nutrigenomics.
4. Construct a semantic graph representing intertopic relationships and dependencies, fostering enhanced information retrieval and contextual understanding within the nutrigenomics domain.
