Dementia disease research encompasses diverse data modalities, including advanced imaging, deep phenotyping, and multi-omics analysis. However, integrating these disparate data sources has historically posed a significant challenge, obstructing the unification and comprehensive analysis of collected information. In recent years, knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to address such integration issues by enabling the consolidation of heterogeneous data sources into a structured, interconnected network of knowledge. In this context, we introduce DemKG, an open-source framework designed to facilitate the construction of a knowledge graph integrating dementia research data, comprising three core components: a KG-builder that integrates diverse domain ontologies and data annotations, an extensions ontology providing necessary terms tailored for dementia research, and a versatile transformation module for incorporating study data. In contrast with other current solutions, our framework provides a stable foundation by leveraging established ontologies and community standards and simplifies study data integration while delivering solid ontology design patterns, broadening its usability. Furthermore, the modular approach of its components enhances flexibility and scalability. We showcase how DemKG might aid and improve multi-modal data investigations through a series of proof-of-concept scenarios focused on relevant Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. © 2023 by the authors.","data modeling; dementia; graph databases; knowledge graphs; omics; ontologies","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173013109"

However, kidney transplant rejection (KTR) is commonly observed to have negative effects on allograft function. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with regulatory role in KTR genesis, the identification of miRNA biomarkers for accurate diagnosis and subtyping of KTR is therefore of clinical significance for active intervention and personalized therapy. Methods: In this study, an integrative bioinformatics model was developed based on multi-omics network characterization for miRNA biomarker discovery in KTR. Compared with existed methods, the topological importance of miRNA targets was prioritized based on cross-level miRNA-mRNA and protein–protein interaction network analyses. The biomarker potential of identified miRNAs was computationally validated and explored by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) evaluation and integrated “miRNA-gene-pathway” pathogenic survey. Results: Three miRNAs, i.e., miR-145-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-23b-3p, were screened as putative biomarkers for KTR monitoring. Among them, miR-155-5p was a previously reported signature in KTR, whereas the remaining two were novel candidates both for KTR diagnosis and subtyping. The ROC analysis convinced the power of identified miRNAs as single and combined biomarkers for KTR prediction in kidney tissue and blood samples. Functional analyses, including the latent crosstalk among HLA-related genes, immune signaling pathways and identified miRNAs, provided new insights of these miRNAs in KTR pathogenesis. Conclusions: A network-based bioinformatics approach was proposed and applied to identify candidate miRNA biomarkers for KTR study. Biological and clinical validations are further needed for translational applications of the findings. © 2021, The Author(s).","Allograft rejection; Kidney transplantation; miRNA biomarkers; Multi-omics network modeling; Systems biology","Biomarkers; Biomarkers, Tumor; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; MicroRNAs; ROC Curve; biological marker; microRNA; microRNA 145 5p; microRNA 155 5p; microRNA 23b 3p; unclassified drug; biological marker; microRNA; MIRN145 microRNA, human; tumor marker; Article; blood sampling; clinical feature; down regulation; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; human; immune signaling; kidney graft rejection; kidney tissue; kidney transplantation; molecular interaction; multiomics; pathogenesis; protein protein interaction; upregulation; biology; gene expression profiling; genetics; kidney transplantation; receiver operating characteristic","","BioMed Central Ltd","34389032","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112434933"

As proof-of-concept we challenge network modeling with time-resolved proteome, transcriptome and methylome measurements in iPSC-derived human 3D cardiac microtissues to elucidate adverse mechanisms of anthracycline cardiotoxicity measured with four different drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin and daunorubicin). Dynamic molecular analysis at in vivo drug exposure levels reveal a network of 175 disease-associated proteins and identify common modules of anthracycline cardiotoxicity in vitro, related to mitochondrial and sarcomere function as well as remodeling of extracellular matrix. These in vitro-identified modules are transferable and are evaluated with biopsies of cardiomyopathy patients.

Currently available technologies produce wide variety of large amount of data spanning from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenetics. Due to the fact that such multi-omics data are very diverse and come from different biological levels, it has been a major research challenge to develop a model to properly integrate all available and relevant data to advance biomedical research. It has been argued by many researchers that the integration of multi-omics data to extract relevant biological information is currently one of the major biomedical informatics challenges. This paper proposes a new graph database model to efficiently store and mine multi-omics data. We show a working model of this graph database with transcriptomics, genomics, epigenetics and clinical data for three cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas.

These regulatory mechanisms have strong connections with cellular metabolism. In order to study the cellular system and its functioning, omics data at each molecular level can be generated and efficiently integrated. Here, we propose BRANEnet, a novel multi-omics integration framework for multilayer heterogeneous networks. BRANEnet is an expressive, scalable, and versatile method to learn node embeddings, leveraging random walk information within a matrix factorization framework. Our goal is to efficiently integrate multi-omics data to study different regulatory aspects of multilayered processes that occur in organisms. We evaluate our framework using multi-omics data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-studied yeast model organism. Results: We test BRANEnet on transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and targeted metabolomics (NMR) data for wild-type yeast strain during a heat-shock time course of 0, 20, and 120 min. Our framework learns features for differentially expressed bio-molecules showing heat stress response.

Results: Here, we introduce ClustOmics, a generic consensus clustering tool that we use in the context of cancer subtyping. ClustOmics relies on a non-relational graph database, which allows for the simultaneous integration of both multiple omics data and results from various clustering methods. This new tool conciliates input clusterings, regardless of their origin, their number, their size or their shape. ClustOmics implements an intuitive and flexible strategy, based upon the idea of evidence accumulation clustering. ClustOmics computes co-occurrences of pairs of samples in input clusters and uses this score as a similarity measure to reorganize data into consensus clusters. Conclusion: We applied ClustOmics to multi-omics disease subtyping on real TCGA cancer data from ten different cancer types. We showed that ClustOmics is robust to heterogeneous qualities of input partitions, smoothing and reconciling preliminary predictions into high-quality consensus clusters, both from a computational and a biological point of view. The comparison to a state-of-the-art consensus-based integration tool, COCA, further corroborated this statement. However, the main interest of ClustOmics is not to compete with other tools, but rather to make profit from their various predictions when no gold-standard metric is available to assess their significance.

Precision medicine focuses on individual-level disease treatment and prevention. Here, we propose the usage of the term 'precision omics' to represent the combinatorial strategy that applies omics to translate large-scale molecular omics data for precision disease understanding and accurate disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Given the complexity of both omics and precision medicine, precision omics requires standardized representation and integration of heterogeneous data types. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial intelligence component to become critical for standard data and metadata representation, standardization and integration. To support precision omics, we propose a precision omics ontology hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the effectiveness of precision omics is positively correlated with the interoperability of ontologies used for data and knowledge integration. Therefore, to make effective precision omics studies, interoperable ontologies are required to standardize and incorporate heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. Methods for efficient development and application of interoperable ontologies are proposed and illustrated. With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, omics tools such as OmicsViz can also be evolved to process, integrate, visualize and analyze various omics data, leading to the identification of new knowledge and hypotheses of molecular mechanisms underlying the outcomes of diseases such as COVID-19. Given extensive COVID-19 omics research, we propose the strategy of precision omics supported by interoperable ontologies, accompanied with ontology-based semantic reasoning and machine learning, leading to systematic disease mechanism understanding and rational design of precision treatment and prevention. Short Abstract: Precision medicine focuses on individual-level disease treatment and prevention. Precision omics is a new strategy that applies omics for precision medicine research, which requires standardized representation and integration of individual genetics and phenotypes, experimental conditions, and data analysis settings. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial intelligence component to become critical for standard data and metadata representation, standardization and integration. To support precision omics, interoperable ontologies are required in order to standardize and incorporate heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, omics tools such as OmicsViz can also be evolved to process, integrate, visualize and analyze various omics data, leading to the identification of new knowledge and hypotheses of molecular mechanisms underlying disease outcomes. The precision COVID-19 omics study is provided as the primary use case to illustrate the rationale and implementation of the precision omics strategy.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Moreover, its diagnosis and follow-up need repeated endoscopies due to absence of non-invasive validated biomarkers. In the present study, we aimed to deeply describe local immunological and molecular components of EoE in well-phenotyped children, and to identify potential circulating EoE-biomarkers. Methods: Blood and oesophageal biopsies were collected simultaneously from French children with EoE (n=17) and from control subjects (n=15). Untargeted transcriptomics analysis was performed on mRNA extracted from biopsies using microarrays. In parallel, we performed a comprehensive analysis of immune components on both cellular and soluble extracts obtained from both biopsies and blood, using flow cytometry. Finally, we performed non-targeted plasma metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Uni/multivariate supervised and non-supervised statistical analyses were then conducted to identify significant and discriminant components associated with EoE within local and/or systemic transcriptomics, immunologic and metabolomics datasets. As a proof of concept, we conducted multi-omics data integration to identify a plasmatic signature of EoE. Results: French children with EoE shared the same transcriptomic signature as US patients. Network visualization of differentially expressed (DE) genes highlighted the major dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune processes, but also of pathways involved in epithelial cells and barrier functions, and in perception of chemical stimuli. Immune analysis of biopsies highlighted EoE is associated with dysregulation of both type (T) 1, T2 and T3 innate and adaptive immunity, in a highly inflammatory milieu. Although an immune signature of EoE was found in blood, untargeted metabolomics more efficiently discriminated children with EoE from control subjects, with dysregulation of vitamin B6 and various amino acids metabolisms. Multi-blocks integration suggested that an EoE plasma signature may be identified by combining metabolomics and cytokines datasets. Conclusions: Our study strengthens the evidence that EoE results from alterations of the oesophageal epithelium associated with altered immune responses far beyond a simplistic T2 dysregulation. As a proof of concept, combining metabolomics and cytokines data may provide a set of potential plasma biomarkers for EoE diagnosis, which needs to be confirmed on a larger and independent cohort.

With so many research groups generating their own data, the ability to relate it to the larger genomic and comparative genomic context is becoming increasingly crucial to make full use of the data. Results: The Omics Database Generator (ODG) allows users to create customized databases that utilize published genomics data integrated with experimental data which can be queried using a flexible graph database. When provided with omics and experimental data, ODG will create a comparative, multi-dimensional graph database. ODG can import definitions and annotations from other sources such as InterProScan, the Gene Ontology, ENZYME, UniPathway, and others. This annotation data can be especially useful for studying new or understudied species for which transcripts have only been predicted, and rapidly give additional layers of annotation to predicted genes. In better studied species, ODG can perform syntenic annotation translations or rapidly identify characteristics of a set of genes or nucleotide locations, such as hits from an association study. ODG provides a web-based user-interface for configuring the data import and for querying the database. Queries can also be run from the command-line and the database can be queried directly through programming language hooks available for most languages. ODG supports most common genomic formats as well as generic, easy to use tab-separated value format for user-provided annotations. Conclusions: ODG is a user-friendly database generation and query tool that adapts to the supplied data to produce a comparative genomic database or multi-layered annotation database. ODG provides rapid comparative genomic annotation and is therefore particularly useful for non-model or understudied species. For species for which more data are available, ODG can be used to conduct complex multi-omics, pattern-matching queries. © 2017 The Author(s).","Annotation; Comparative genomics; Data integration; Graph database; Non-model species","Databases, Nucleic Acid; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Software; Database systems; Genes; Pattern matching; Query languages; Query processing; User interfaces; Annotated datasets; Annotation; Comparative genomic; Comparative genomics; Database generation; Graph database; Model species; Systemic integration; genomics; molecular genetics; nucleic acid database; software; Data integration","","BioMed Central Ltd.","28797229","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027521412"

Here we report on our preliminary work in utilizing SNOMED-CT as both a tool for translational data discovery, and a major component in a framework for the large-scale integration of gene expression microarray data and clinical laboratory data. Annotations from microarray experiments in NCBI GEO were mapped to SNOMED-CT terms using UMLS, and these mappings were joined to clinical laboratory data using ICD9CM to SNOMED-CT mappings within UMLS. We find that microarray experiments characterizing 211 distinct diseases can be mapped to clinical laboratory data measurements for 13,452 distinct patients. We maintain that this work represents critical first steps in providing a foundation for large-scale translational data integration, and underlines the important role that controlled clinical terminologies, such as SNOMEDCT, can play in addressing such problems.","","Bioinformatics; Experiments; Gene expression; Genetic engineering; Industrial research; Knowledge representation; Biomedical data integration; Clinical data; Clinical terminology; Data discovery; Data integration; Data measurements; Gene expression microarray; Genomics; ICD9-CM; Microarray experiments; Translational Research; Clinical laboratories","","","","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872863395"

In parallel, integrative multi-omics investigations have generated high-resolution molecular maps of putative relevance for understanding disease initiation and progression. Yet, it is unclear how to advance an observation of comorbidity relations (one disease to others) to a molecular understanding of the driver processes and associated biomarkers. Results: Since Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) has emerged as a central hub in temporal comorbidity networks, we developed a systematic integrative data-driven framework to identify shared disease-associated genes and pathways, as a proxy for the underlying generative mechanisms inducing comorbidity. We integrated records from approximately 13 M patients from the Medicare database with disease-gene maps that we derived from several resources including a semantic-derived knowledge-base. Using rank-based statistics we not only recovered known comorbidities but also discovered a novel association between COPD and digestive diseases. Furthermore, our analysis provides the first set of COPD co-morbidity candidate biomarkers, including IL15, TNF and JUP, and characterizes their association to aging and life-style conditions, such as smoking and physical activity. Conclusions: The developed framework provides novel insights in COPD and especially COPD co-morbidity associated mechanisms. The methodology could be used to discover and decipher the molecular underpinning of other comorbidity relationships and furthermore, allow the identification of candidate co-morbidity biomarkers. © 2016 The Author(s).","","Aging; Biomarkers; Chromosome Mapping; Cluster Analysis; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Disease Progression; Humans; Life Style; Principal Component Analysis; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Risk; Smoking; Biomarkers; Data integration; Epidemiology; Genes; Health insurance; Knowledge based systems; Semantics; biological marker; Associated mechanism; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Disease initiations; Generative mechanism; Molecular mechanism; Molecular understanding; Novel associations; Physical activity; aging; chromosomal mapping; cluster analysis; comorbidity; disease course; factual database; genetics; human; lifestyle; metabolism; pathology; principal component analysis; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; risk; smoking; Pulmonary diseases","","BioMed Central Ltd.","28185567","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84998706906"

We present a new pathway relevance ranking method that is able to prioritize pathways according to the information contained in any combination of tumor related omics datasets. Key to the method is the conversion of all available data into a single comprehensive network representation containing not only genes but also individual patient samples. Additionally, all data are linked through a network of previously identified molecular interactions. We demonstrate the performance of the new method by applying it to breast and ovarian cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By integrating gene expression, copy number, mutation and methylation data, the method's potential to identify key pathways involved in breast cancer development shared by different molecular subtypes is illustrated. Interestingly, certain pathways were ranked equally important for different subtypes, even when the underlying (epi)-genetic disturbances were diverse. Next to prioritizing universally high-scoring pathways, the pathway ranking method was able to identify subtype-specific pathways. Often the score of a pathway could not be motivated by a single mutation, copy number or methylation alteration, but rather by a combination of genetic and epi-genetic disturbances, stressing the need for a network-based data integration approach. The analysis of ovarian tumors, as a function of survival-based subtypes, demonstrated the method's ability to correctly identify key pathways, irrespective of tumor subtype. A differential analysis of survival-based subtypes revealed several pathways with higher importance for the bad-outcome patient group than for the good-outcome patient group. Many of the pathways exhibiting higher importance for the bad-outcome patient group could be related to ovarian tumor proliferation and survival.

However, there are great challenges in integrating multi-omics using machine learning methods for cancer subtype classification. In this study, MoGCN, a multi-omics integration model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) was developed for cancer subtype classification and analysis. Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets for 511 breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) samples were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The autoencoder (AE) and the similarity network fusion (SNF) methods were used to reduce dimensionality and construct the patient similarity network (PSN), respectively. Then the vector features and the PSN were input into the GCN for training and testing. Feature extraction and network visualization were used for further biological knowledge discovery and subtype classification. In the analysis of multi-dimensional omics data of the BRCA samples in TCGA, MoGCN achieved the highest accuracy in cancer subtype classification compared with several popular algorithms. Moreover, MoGCN can extract the most significant features of each omics layer and provide candidate functional molecules for further analysis of their biological effects. And network visualization showed that MoGCN could make clinically intuitive diagnosis. The generality of MoGCN was proven on the TCGA pan-kidney cancer datasets. MoGCN and datasets are public available at https://github.com/Lifoof/MoGCN. Our study shows that MoGCN performs well for heterogeneous data integration and the interpretability of classification results, which confers great potential for applications in biomarker identification and clinical diagnosis.

We developed the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), a comprehensive system for sharing sleep data. The NSRR embodies elements of a data commons aimed at accelerating research to address critical questions about the impact of sleep disorders on important health outcomes. Approach We used a metadata-guided approach, with a set of common sleep-specific terms enforcing uniform semantic interpretation of data elements across three main components: (1) annotated datasets; (2) user interfaces for accessing data; and (3) computational tools for the analysis of polysomnography recordings. We incorporated the process for managing dataset-specific data use agreements, evidence of Institutional Review Board review, and the corresponding access control in the NSRR web portal. The metadata-guided approach facilitates structural and semantic interoperability, ultimately leading to enhanced data reusability and scientific rigor. Results The authors curated and deposited retrospective data from 10 large, NIH-funded sleep cohort studies, including several from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, into the NSRR. The NSRR currently contains data on 26 808 subjects and 31 166 signal files in European Data Format. Launched in April 2014, over 3000 registered users have downloaded over 130 terabytes of data. Conclusions The NSRR offers a use case and an example for creating a full-fledged data commons. It provides a single point of access to analysis-ready physiological signals from polysomnography obtained from multiple sources, and a wide variety of clinical data to facilitate sleep research. © © The Author(s) 2018.

In this review, we have discussed various computational approaches implemented to infer and analyze two of the most important and well studied interactomes: protein-protein interaction networks and gene co-expression networks. We have explicitly focused on recent methods and pipelines implemented to infer and extract biologically important information from these interactomes, starting from utilizing single-omics data and then progressing towards multi-omics data. Accordingly, recent examples and case studies are also briefly discussed.

The advance of experiment methods and information retrieval technologies leads to explosive growth of scientific data and databases. However, due to the heterogeneous problems in data formats, structures and semantics, it is hard to integrate the diversified data that grow explosively and analyse them comprehensively. As more and more public databases are accessible through standard protocols like programmable interfaces and Web portals, Web-based data integration becomes a major trend to manage and synthesise data that are stored in distributed locations. Mashup, a Web 2.0 technique, presents a new way to compose content and software from multiple resources. The paper proposes a layered framework for integrating pharmacogenomics data in a service-oriented approach using the mashup technology. The framework separates the integration concerns from three perspectives including data, process and Web-based user interface. Each layer encapsulates the heterogeneous issues of one aspect. To facilitate the mapping and convergence of data, the ontology mechanism is introduced to provide consistent conceptual models across different databases and experiment platforms. To support user-interactive and iterative service orchestration, a context model is defined to capture information of users, tasks and services, which can be used for service selection and recommendation during a dynamic service composition process. A prototype system is implemented and cases studies are presented to illustrate the promising capabilities of the proposed approach. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","context-awareness; data as a service; mashup; ontology; Web services","Data handling; Database systems; Distributed computer systems; Experiments; Integration; Ontology; User interfaces; Web services; Conceptual model; Context models; Context- awareness; Data format; Data integration; Dynamic service composition; Experiment methods; Explosive growth; Information-retrieval technology; Multiple resources; Ontology web services; Pharmacogenomics; Prototype system; Public database; Scientific data; Scientific researches; Service mashup; Service orchestration; Service Oriented; Service selection; Service-based; Standard protocols; Web 2.0; Web portal; Internet protocols","","","","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955549084"

In particular, systems supporting the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) principles of scientific data management. Results: We propose a Service Oriented Architecture approach for integrated management and analysis of multi-omics and biomedical imaging data. Our architecture introduces an image management system into a FAIR-supporting, web-based platform for omics data management. Interoperable metadata models and middleware components implement the required data management operations. The resulting architecture allows for FAIR management of omics and imaging data, facilitating metadata queries from software applications. The applicability of the proposed architecture is demonstrated using two technical proofs of concept and a use case, aimed at molecular plant biology and clinical liver cancer research, which integrate various imaging and omics modalities. Conclusions: We describe a data management architecture for integrated, FAIR-supporting management of omics and biomedical imaging data, and exemplify its applicability for basic biology research and clinical studies. We anticipate that FAIR data management systems for multi-modal data repositories will play a pivotal role in data-driven research, including studies which leverage advanced machine learning methods, as the joint analysis of omics and imaging data, in conjunction with phenotypic metadata, becomes not only desirable but necessary to derive novel insights into biological processes. © 2022, The Author(s).","Data integration; Data management infrastructure; Distributed systems; Imaging; Metadata models; Omics; Service oriented architecture","Biological Science Disciplines; Data Management; Information Management; Metadata; Software; Application programs; Clinical research; Data integration; Information management; Information services; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Metadata; Middleware; Modal analysis; Plants (botany); Reusability; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); 'omics'; Biomedical imaging; Data generation; Data management infrastructure; Imaging data; Life-sciences; Management infrastructure; Metadata model; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); Technical development; biomedicine; information processing; information system; metadata; software; Interoperability","","BioMed Central Ltd","35130839","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124439356"

Therefore, identification of genetic factors to understand and decrease the morbidity and mortality from complex diseases is an important and challenging task. With the generation of an unprecedented amount of multi-omics datasets, network-based methods have become popular to represent the multilayered complex molecular interactions. Particularly node embeddings, the low-dimensional representations of nodes in a network are utilized for gene function prediction. Integrated network analysis of multi-omics data alleviates the issues related to missing data and lack of context-specific datasets. Most of the node embedding methods, however, are unable to integrate multiple types of datasets from genes and phenotypes. To address this limitation, we developed a node embedding algorithm called Node Embeddings of Complex networks (NECo) that can utilize multilayered heterogeneous networks of genes and phenotypes. We evaluated the performance of NECo using genotypic and phenotypic datasets from rat (Rattus norvegicus) disease models to classify hypertension disease-related genes. Our method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art node embedding methods, with AUC of 94.97% compared 85.98% in the second-best performer, and predicted genes not previously implicated in hypertension. © 2020 IEEE.","complex disease; disease gene prediction; feature learning; genotype to phenotype mapping; graph representation; hypertension; multi-omics data integration; multiplex heterogeneous networks; Network integration; network propagation; node embedding; random walk with restart; rat","Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); Diseases; Embeddings; Genes; Heterogeneous networks; Embedding algorithms; Environmental factors; Gene function prediction; Hypertension disease; Integrated networks; Low-dimensional representation; Multilayered complexes; State of the art; Complex networks","Park T.; Cho Y.-R.; Hu X.T.; Yoo I.; Woo H.G.; Wang J.; Facelli J.; Nam S.; Kang M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100330604"

Aided by advances in analytical chemistry and bioinformatics, clinical proteomics has become a driving force behind molecular biomarker development. However, it is still difficult to manage and interpret large amounts of clinical proteomics data due to data integration challenges. The lack of practical metadata representation standards has prevented sharing and interpretation of mass spectrometry experimental results derived from different experimental conditions or different proteomics labs, and ultimately this absence has resulted in missed opportunities for proteomic biomarker discovery. Therefore, in this paper, we describe methods for deploying Semantic Web technologies to design an ontology using OWL for clinical proteomics information and to manage such information using various mechanisms, such as CPAS. We developed a practical proteomics experimental metadata model using Semantic Web technologies and demonstrated the manner in which this model can be integrated with current proteomics data analysis software systems. We demonstrated the manner in which systems employing the metadata model can begin to enable inter-laboratory sharing and analysis of clinical proteomics data. We also discussed the manner in which these tools and techniques have aided in proteomic biomarker discovery studies. Our work reflects an approach to adopt a Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) compliant software system through the use of an ontology-based metadata model. This effort is the first step in a bigger initiative to move toward an ontology-based approach that enables a standards-driven approach to large-scale inter-laboratory proteomics data integration and analyses with the overarching goal of the discovery of proteomic biomarkers. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.","Clinical proteomics; OWL; RDF; Semantic web","biological marker; article; Computational Proteomics Analysis System; data analysis software; information technology; mass spectrometry; medical informatics; medical information system; priority journal; proteomics; web browser","","","","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866685340"

Research efforts have so far been directed to improving GWAS techniques rather than on making the results of GWAS interoperable with other genomic signals; this is currently hindered by the use of heterogeneous formats and uncoordinated experiment descriptions. Results: To practically facilitate integrative use, we propose to include GWAS datasets within the META-BASE repository, exploiting an integration pipeline previously studied for other genomic datasets that includes several heterogeneous data types in the same format, queryable from the same systems. We represent GWAS SNPs and metadata by means of the Genomic Data Model and include metadata within a relational representation by extending the Genomic Conceptual Model with a dedicated view. To further reduce the gap with the descriptions of other signals in the repository of genomic datasets, we perform a semantic annotation of phenotypic traits. Our pipeline is demonstrated using two important data sources, initially organized according to different data models: the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and FinnGen (University of Helsinki). The integration effort finally allows us to use these datasets within multi-sample processing queries that respond to important biological questions. These are then made usable for multi-omic studies together with, e.g., somatic and reference mutation data, genomic annotations, epigenetic signals. Conclusions: As a result of the our work on GWAS datasets, we enable 1) their interoperable use with several other homogenized and processed genomic datasets in the context of the META-BASE repository; 2) their big data processing by means of the GenoMetric Query Language and associated system. Future large-scale tertiary data analysis may extensively benefit from the addition of GWAS results to inform several different downstream analysis workflows. © 2023, The Author(s).","Data integration; Genomics; GWAS; Multiomics studies; Processed datasets; Tertiary data analysis","Big Data; Data Analysis; Epigenomics; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; article; big data; conceptual model; data analysis; data integration; data source; epigenetics; genome-wide association study; genomics; human; human experiment; language; metadata; multiomics; pipeline; single nucleotide polymorphism; workflow; data analysis","","BioMed Central Ltd","36869294","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149541411"

Monitoring the fate of millions of transplanted clones and their progeny across differentiation and proliferation over time leverages the identification of the vector integration sites, used as surrogates of clonal identity. Although Υtracking retroviral insertion sites (Υ-TRIS) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for clonal identification, the computational drawbacks in the tracking algorithm, based on a combinatorial all-versus-all strategy, limit its use in clinical studies with several thousands of samples per patient.We developed the first clonal tracking graph database, InCliniGene (https://github.com/calabrialab/InCliniGene), that imports the output files of Υ-TRIS and generates the graph of clones (nodes) connected by arches if two nodes share common genomic features as defined by the Υ-TRIS rules. Embedding both clonal data and their connections in the graph, InCliniGene can track all clones longitudinally over samples through data queries that fully explore the graph.This approach resulted in being highly accurate and scalable.We validated InCliniGene using an in vitro dataset, specifically designed to mimic clinical cases, and tested the accuracy and precision. InCliniGene allows extensive use of Υ-TRIS in large gene therapy clinical applications and naturally realizes the full data integration of molecular and genomics data, clinical and treatment measurements and genomic annotations. Further extensions of InCliniGene with data federation and with application programming interface will support data mining toward precision, personalized and predictive medicine in gene therapy. © The Author(s) 2023.","","article; data integration; data mining; embedding; gene therapy; genomics; human; in vitro study","","Oxford University Press","37935583","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176385747"

In this context, a lot of biological data integration systems have been deployed in the last couple of decades. One of the prime and common objectives of all these systems is to better facilitate the end-users for exploring, exploiting, and analyzing the integrated biological data for knowledge extraction. With the advent of especially high-throughput data generation technologies, biological data is growing and dispersing continuously, exponentially, heterogeneously, and geographically. Due to this, biological data integration systems face data integration and data organization-related current and future challenges. The objective of this review is to quantitatively evaluate and compare some of the recent warehouse-based multi-omics data integration systems to check their compliance with the current and future data integration needs. For this, we identified some of the major data integration design characteristics that should be in the multi-omics data integration model to comprehensively address the current and future data integration challenges. Based on these design characteristics and the evaluation criteria, we evaluated some of the recent data warehouse systems and showed categorical and comparative analysis results. Results show that most of the systems exhibit no or partial compliance with the required data integration design characteristics. So, these systems need design improvements to adequately address the current and future data integration challenges while keeping their service level commitments in place. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Data analysis; Data heterogeneity; Data integration; Data schema characteristics; Data warehouse; Multi-omics; Semantic data schema; Syntax-based data schema","data analysis; data integration; data warehouse; human; human cell; knowledge discovery; multiomics; quantitative analysis; review","","Bentham Science Publishers","","Review","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117118981"

Starting with transcriptome analyses, single-cell techniques have extended to multi-omics approaches and now enable the simultaneous measurement of data modalities and spatial cellular context. Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference. In choosing a data integration strategy, consideration must be given to whether the multi-omics data are matched (that is, measured on the same cell) or unmatched (that is, measured on different cells) and, more importantly, the overall modelling and visualization goals of the integrated analysis. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.","","Computational Biology; Data Analysis; Data Visualization; Epigenomics; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Proteomics; Single-Cell Analysis; transcriptome; biological activity; biological model; biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism; biotechnology; cell assay; cells by body anatomy; classification; consensus; cytology; data base; data integration; data processing; genome analysis; human; multiomics; nonhuman; procedures concerning cells; quantitative study; regulatory mechanism; Review; RNA analysis; statistical model; validation study; biology; data analysis; epigenetics; gene expression profiling; genomics; proteomics; single cell analysis","","Nature Research","34417589","Review","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113196912"

We aimed to address this issue by developing a new data integration/representation methodology and its application by constructing a biological data resource. CROssBAR is a comprehensive system that integrates large-scale biological/biomedical data from various resources and stores them in a NoSQL database. CROssBAR is enriched with the deep-learning-based prediction of relationships between numerous data entries, which is followed by the rigorous analysis of the enriched data to obtain biologically meaningful modules. These complex sets of entities and relationships are displayed to users via easy-to-interpret, interactive knowledge graphs within an open-access service. CROssBAR knowledge graphs incorporate relevant genes-proteins, molecular interactions, pathways, phenotypes, diseases, as well as known/predicted drugs and bioactive compounds, and they are constructed on-the-fly based on simple non-programmatic user queries.

APODHIN works on a meta-interactome network consisting of human protein–protein interactions (PPIs), miRNA-target gene regulatory interactions, and transcription factor-target gene regulatory relationships. In its first module, APODHIN maps proteins/genes/miRNAs from different omics data in its meta-interactome network and extracts the network of biomolecules that are differentially altered in the given scenario. Using this context specific, filtered interaction network, APODHIN identifies topologically important nodes (TINs) implementing graph theory based network topology analysis and further justifies their role via pathway and disease marker mapping. These TINs could be used as prospective diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers and/or potential therapeutic targets. In its second module, APODHIN attempts to identify cross pathway regulatory and PPI links connecting signaling proteins, transcription factors (TFs), and miRNAs to metabolic enzymes via utilization of single-omics and/or pan-omics data and implementation of mathematical modeling. Interconnections between regulatory components such as signaling proteins/TFs/miRNAs and metabolic pathways need to be elucidated more elaborately in order to understand the role of oncogene and tumor suppressors in regulation of metabolic reprogramming during cancer.

These big data provide an unprecedented opportunity in biology, but impose great challenges in data integration, data mining, and knowledge discovery due to the complexity, heterogeneity, dynamics, uncertainty, and high-dimensionality inherited in the omics data. Network has been widely used to represent relations between entities in biological system, such as protein-protein interaction, gene regulation, and brain connectivity (i.e. network construction) as well as to infer novel relations given a reconstructed network (aka link prediction). Particularly, heterogeneous multi-layered network (HMLN) has proven successful in integrating diverse biological data for the representation of the hierarchy of biological system. The HMLN provides unparalleled opportunities but imposes new computational challenges on establishing causal genotype-phenotype associations and understanding environmental impact on organisms. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in developing novel computational methods for the inference of novel biological relations from the HMLN. We first discuss the properties of biological HMLN. Then we survey four categories of state-of-the-art methods (matrix factorization, random walk, knowledge graph, and deep learning). Thirdly, we demonstrate their applications to omics data integration and analysis. Finally, we outline strategies for future directions in the development of new HMLN models. © Copyright © 2020 Lee, Zhang, Poleksic and Xie.","biological data analysis; biological network; data mining and knowledge discovery; deep learning; link prediction; machine learning; relation inference","biology; data analysis; data integration; data mining; deep learning; environmental impact; genotype; knowledge discovery; phenotype; prediction; review","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Review","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079483860"

This system takes advantage of the Apache Spark framework to perform the query transformation and execution needed to question the integrated data sources.

Computational methods are required for extracting meaningful relationships across different omics layers. Various tools have been developed to facilitate integration of paired heterogenous omics data; however most existing tools allow integration of only two omics datasets. Furthermore, existing data integration tools do not incorporate additional steps of identifying sub-networks or communities of highly connected entities and evaluating the topology of the integrative network under different conditions. Here we present xMWAS, a software for data integration, network visualization, clustering, and differential network analysis of data from biochemical and phenotypic assays, and two or more omics platforms.

The critical and lethal advancement of this disease is associated with the failure of multiple organs including, but not limited to, the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, etc., which makes it very challenging to understand. Current high-throughput technologies generate multi-omics datasets to enable a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of different organs at the cellular and molecular level. To understand the multi-organ impact of COVID-19 and the mechanistic aspects of disease prognosis and its interactions with other comorbidities, computational approaches need to be implemented by integrating data from multiple organs, correlating results across data types, and applying machine learning (ML) tools on the high-throughput data. This chapter is expected to provide valuable insights to help explain the multi-organ association of COVID-19 using state-of-the-art computational resources and modeling of high-volume data. We have emphasized the importance of big data analytics and systematic integration of data from different domains including omics, clinical, demographic, and others in understanding the organ- and system-level biological processes and comorbidity networks associated with COVID-19. These findings and proposed strategies could help perform comorbidity-focused studies to understand and tackle COVID-19. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Comorbidity network modeling; COVID-19 comorbidities; Data integration; Machine learning","Big data; Biological organs; Data Analytics; Data integration; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Biological process; Computational approach; Computational resources; High throughput technology; High-throughput data; In-depth analysis; Mechanistic aspects; Systematic integration; Advanced Analytics","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","Book chapter","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105468835"

We surveyed their methods, disease similarity metrics, and calculation of comorbidities in the electronic health records, if present.; RESULTS: Among the surveyed studies, 44% generated or validated disease similarity metrics in context of comorbidity, with 60% being published in the last two years. As inputs, 87% of studies utilized intragenic loci and proteins while 13% employed RNA (mRNA, LncRNA or miRNA). Network modeling was predominantly used (35%) followed by statistics (28%) to impute similarity between these biomolecules and diseases. Studies with large numbers of biomolecules and diseases used network models or naïve overlap of disease-molecule associations, while machine learning, statistics, and information retrieval were utilized in smaller and moderate sized studies. Multiscale computations comprising shared function, network topology, and phenotypes were performed exclusively on proteins.; CONCLUSION: This review highlighted the growing methods for identifying the molecular mechanisms underpinning comorbidities that leverage multiscale molecular information and patterns from electronic health records. The survey unveiled that intergenic polymorphisms have been overlooked for similarity imputation compared to their intragenic counterparts, offering new opportunities to bridge the mechanistic and similarity gaps of comorbidity.; OBJECTIVES: Disease comorbidity is a pervasive phenomenon impacting patients' health outcomes, disease management, and clinical decisions. This review presents past, current and future research directions leveraging both phenotypic and molecular information to uncover disease similarity underpinning the biology and etiology of disease comorbidity.","biomolecules; Comorbidity; disease similarity; electronic health records; function; integrative data analysis; modularity; omics; phenome","Bibliometrics; Comorbidity; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Datasets as Topic; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Variation; Genomics; Humans; Phenotype; bibliometrics; biology; comorbidity; data mining; electronic health record; genetic variation; genomics; human; information processing; phenotype","","","27830251","Review","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021858894"

A new approach to integration of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and human interactome in the drug discovery and development process is essential for this endeavor. Methods: In this study, we developed AlzGPS (Genome-wide Positioning Systems platform for Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery, https://alzgps.lerner.ccf.org), a comprehensive systems biology tool to enable searching, visualizing, and analyzing multi-omics, various types of heterogeneous biological networks, and clinical databases for target identification and development of effective prevention and treatment for AD. Results: Via AlzGPS: (1) we curated more than 100 AD multi-omics data sets capturing DNA, RNA, protein, and small molecule profiles underlying AD pathogenesis (e.g., early vs. late stage and tau or amyloid endophenotype); (2) we constructed endophenotype disease modules by incorporating multi-omics findings and human protein-protein interactome networks; (3) we provided possible treatment information from ~ 3000 FDA approved/investigational drugs for AD using state-of-the-art network proximity analyses; (4) we curated nearly 300 literature references for high-confidence drug candidates; (5) we included information from over 1000 AD clinical trials noting drug’s mechanisms-of-action and primary drug targets, and linking them to our integrated multi-omics view for targets and network analysis results for the drugs; (6) we implemented a highly interactive web interface for database browsing and network visualization. Conclusions: Network visualization enabled by AlzGPS includes brain-specific neighborhood networks for genes-of-interest, endophenotype disease module networks for omics-of-interest, and mechanism-of-action networks for drugs targeting disease modules. By virtue of combining systems pharmacology and network-based integrative analysis of multi-omics data, AlzGPS offers actionable systems biology tools for accelerating therapeutic development in AD. © 2021, The Author(s).","Alzheimer’s disease; Clinical trial; Drug repurposing; Genomics; Mechanism-of-action; Multi-omics; Network medicine; Systems pharmacology","Alzheimer Disease; Drug Discovery; Humans; Proteome; Systems Biology; Transcriptome; DNA; protein; RNA; proteome; transcriptome; Alzheimer disease; Article; database management system; drug repositioning; gene targeting; genomics; human; interactomics; nonhuman; omics; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein protein interaction; proteomics; single nucleotide polymorphism; systems biology; transcriptomics; Alzheimer disease; drug development; genetics","","BioMed Central Ltd","33441136","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099335519"

However, integrated analysis of multi-omics data is quite complicated and can hardly be done in an automated way. Thus, a powerful interactive visual mining tool supporting diverse analysis algorithms for identification of driver genes and regulatory modules is much needed. Results: Here, we present a software platform that integrates network visualization with omics data analysis tools seamlessly. The visualization unit supports various options for displaying multi-omics data as well as unique network models for describing sophisticated biological networks such as complex biomolecular reactions. In addition, we implemented diverse in-house algorithms for network analysis including network clustering and over-representation analysis. Novel functions include facile definition and optimized visualization of subgroups, comparison of a series of data sets in an identical network by data-to-visual mapping and subsequent overlaying function, and management of custom interaction networks. Utility of MONGKIE for network-based visual data mining of multi-omics data was demonstrated by analysis of the TCGA glioblastoma data. MONGKIE was developed in Java based on the NetBeans plugin architecture, thus being OS-independent with intrinsic support of module extension by third-party developers. Conclusion: We believe that MONGKIE would be a valuable addition to network analysis software by supporting many unique features and visualization options, especially for analysing multi-omics data sets in cancer and other diseases.

Recent Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) measurements performed with high throughput sequencing techniques (Hi-C) and molecular dynamics studies show that there is a large correlation between co-localization and co-regulation of genes, but these important researches are hampered by the lack of biologists-friendly analysis and visualisation software. In this work we present NuChart-II, a software that allows the user to annotate and visualize a list of input genes with information relying on Hi-C data, integrating knowledge data about genomic features that are involved in the chromosome spatial organization. This software works directly with sequenced reads to identify related Hi-C fragments, with the aim of creating gene-centric neighbourhood graphs on which multi-omics features can be mapped. NuChart-II is a highly optimized implementation of a previous prototype developed in R, in which the graph-based representation of Hi-C data was tested. The prototype showed inevitable problems of scalability while working genome-wide on large datasets: particular attention has been paid in order to obtain an efficient parallel implementation of the software. The normalization of Hi-C data has been modified and improved, in order to provide a reliable estimation of proximity likelihood for the genes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Chromosome conformation capture; Hi-C data; Neighbourhood graph; Parallel computing; Systems biology","Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Chromosomes; Gene expression; Gene expression regulation; Genes; Graphic methods; Molecular dynamics; Parallel processing systems; Chromosome conformation capture (3c); Graph-based representations; Hi-C data; High-throughput sequencing; Neighbourhood graphs; Optimized implementation; Parallel implementations; Systems biology; C (programming language)","Lio P.; di Serio C.; Nonis A.; Tagliaferri R.; Dipartimento di Informatica, Universita degli Studi di Salerno, NeuRoNe Lab, via Giovanni Paolo II 132, Fisciano, Salerno, 84084","Springer Verlag","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949937005"

This paper presents a new computational framework called COMBO (Combining Multi Bio Omics) for generating and analyzing heterogeneous multi-layer networks. Our model uses gene expression and DNA-methylation data. The power of COMBO relies on its ability to join different omics to study the complex interplay between various components in the disease. We tested the reliability and versatility of COMBO on colon and lung adenocarcinoma cancer data obtained from the TCGA database. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biological data integration; Graph database; Multi-layer networks; Multi-omics analysis; Next-Generation sequencing","","Cherifi H.; Mantegna R.N.; Rocha L.M.; Cherifi C.; Miccichè S.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148768601"

Biologists, scientists and researchers are continuously striving for unveiling the mysteries of these functional aspects to improve the health standards of life. For getting such understanding, astronomically growing, heterogeneous and geographically dispersed omics data needs to be critically analyzed. Currently, omics data is available in different types and formats through various data access interfaces. Applications which require off-line and integrated data encounter a lot of data heterogeneity and global dispersion issues. Objective: For facilitating especially such applications, heterogeneous data must be collected, integrated and warehoused in such a loosely coupled way so that each molecular entity can computationally be understood independently or in association with other entities within or across the various cellular aspects. Methods: In this paper, we propose an omics data integration schema and its corresponding data warehouse system for integrating, warehousing and presenting heterogeneous and geographically dispersed omics entities according to the cellular functional aspects. Results & Conclusion: Such aspect-oriented data integration, warehousing and data access interfacing through graphical search, web services and application programing interfaces make our proposed integrated data schema and warehouse system better and useful than other contemporary ones. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Data integration; Data schema; Heterogeneity; Molecular interaction; Multitier architecture; Omics annotations; Omics layer; Warehouse","article; data integration; data warehouse; human cell; knowledge discovery; molecular interaction","","Bentham Science Publishers","","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079845668"

However, due to the heterogeneous problems in data formats, structures and semantics, it is hard to integrate the diversified data that grow explosively and analyze them comprehensively. As more and more public databases are accessible through standard protocols like programmable interfaces and Web portals, Web-based data integration becomes a major trend to manage and synthesize data which are distributed located. The paper proposes a service-based framework to enable queries across various distributed databases in a way that the pharmacogenomics researchers are transparent to the heterogeneous data sources. The research introduces the mashup concepts and technologies for cross-querying and correlating the multi-dimensional data and information over the Internet. © 2009 IEEE.","Data integration; Mashup; SOA; Web Services","Electronic commerce; Internet protocols; Research; Technical presentations; Web services; Data format; Data integration; Distributed database; Heterogeneous data sources; Multidimensional data; Pharmacogenomics; Public database; Service-based; Standard protocols; Web portal; Data handling","","","","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77950994946"

Over the past decade, many excellent tools have been developed to support creation, analysis and visualization of biological networks. However, important limitations remain: most tools are standalone programs, the majority of them focus on protein-protein interaction (PPI) or metabolic networks, and visualizations often suffer from €hairball' effects when networks become large. To help address these limitations, we developed OmicsNet - a novel web-based tool that allows users to easily create different types of molecular interaction networks and visually explore them in a three-dimensional (3D) space. Users can upload one or multiple lists of molecules of interest (genes/proteins, microRNAs, transcription factors or metabolites) to create and merge different types of biological networks. The 3D network visualization system was implemented using the powerful Web Graphics Library (WebGL) technology that works natively in most major browsers. OmicsNet supports force-directed layout, multi-layered perspective layout, as well as spherical layout to help visualize and navigate complex networks. A rich set of functions have been implemented to allow users to perform coloring, shading, topology analysis, and enrichment analysis.
